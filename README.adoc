= spring-up

A Spring CLI focused on developer productivity

== Build

NOTE: Use either JDK11 or JDK17

Normal build without _native_:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

Which you can then run with:
```
java -jar build/libs/spring-up-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

For native build:
```
./gradlew clean build nativeCompile
```

NOTE: You need to have `GRAALVM_HOME` pointing to your _graal_ installation

Which you can then run with:
```
build/native/nativeCompile/spring-up
```

TIP: There is a CI workflow which builds native binaries for linux, macos and windows.
     Published artifacts in CI workflow will get removed daily so take it from
     a latest run which is scheduled nightly.

=== Overview
The command `boot new`, for example invoked by calling 'spring-up boot new' will create a new Spring Boot project named `demo` in a directory named `demo`.

You can configure Spring Up to create Spring Boot projects that are based on existing projects hosted on GitHub and GitLab.  These projects are called `Runnable Project Templates`.

`Runnable Project Templates` are nothing more than Spring Boot projects that compile successfully and showcase code for a specific use-case.
`Runnable Project Templates` do not involve the use of a template engine to generate code.

It is expected that a user or a company will curate a collection of projects to share with other users that represent coding best practices for a particular use-case.
A collection of `Runnable Project Templates` is known as a Template Catalog.

A configuration file lets you specify

 * Github Client ID and default Scopes.
 * List of Runnable Project Templates
 * List of Template Catalogs
 * Default values for the new project' package name and Runnable Project Template.

One of several locations for the configuration file is

 *  `<user.home>`/.config/springup/springup.yml

=== Sample Configuration file

Below is a sample configuration file that should be located in <user.home>`/.config/springup/springup.yml`
