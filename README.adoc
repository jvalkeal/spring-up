A Spring CLI focused on developer productivity

== Build

NOTE: Use either JDK11 or JDK17

Normal build without _native_:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

Which you can then run with:
```
java -jar build/libs/spring-up-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

For native build:
```
./gradlew clean build nativeCompile
```

NOTE: You need to have `GRAALVM_HOME` pointing to your _graal_ installation

Which you can then run with:
```
build/native/nativeCompile/spring-up
```

TIP: There is a CI workflow which builds native binaries for linux, macos and windows.
     Published artifacts in CI workflow will get removed daily so take it from
     a latest run which is scheduled nightly.
